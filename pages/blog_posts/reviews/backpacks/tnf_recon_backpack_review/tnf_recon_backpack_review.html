            <p>
                The North Face Recon backpack starts at $109. TNF markets this 
                bag as a daypack, but I think it can function quite well as a 
                non-intensive outdoor pack as well. After hearing countless 
                positive reviews about this backpack, especially considering 
                its price point, I decided to give it a try.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">The Pros</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                First off, this backpack is quiet. Sounds weird, but bear with 
                me. Have you ever had a backpack with metal zippers that if you 
                shook the backpack, you can hear the sound of the zipprs clacking 
                on each other? Yeah, this backpack does not do that. The North 
                Face did a great job making the backpack quiet. Something I 
                really never thought about until I got this backpack.
                <br>
                <br>
                The materials used in this bag are pretty high quality (and 
                sustainable). TNF uses 100% recycled synthetic materials for 
                the main structure of the bag. TNF also uses other materials 
                like a stretchy water-proof fabric for the water bottle holder, 
                and a stretchy mesh material in the front pocket. For zipper-
                material fanatics, they opted for YKK zippers.
                <br>
                <br>
                What I also like about this bag is that it is 30L, but it does 
                not feel overly large. It can definitely hold 30L, and it sure 
                does feel like 30L when you are actually packing it, but on the 
                exterior, you cannot really tell. This I think makes the
                backpack a great choice for traveling, or a daypack when you're 
                out or commuting.
                <br>
                <br>
                Speaking of this backpack acting as some sort of a hybrid pack, 
                what I also love about this backpack is that it not only 
                contains a sternum strap (with a TNF signature whistle), but 
                also a waist strap for more comfort when outdoors, and stability 
                if used while doing some sort of activity like running or biking. 
                Bonus points for the waist strap being detachable. The shoulder 
                straps are also comfortable. They are thick, padded, and I 
                definitely did not feel like I was overheating like I did with 
                my Bellroy Transit Workpack.
                <br>
                <br>
                If we are also talking about heat, it is also worth mentioning 
                that the back panel of the backpack is well-padded 
                and contains a central vent.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are a lot of compartments, and organizational features of 
                this backpack. There are sleeping pad straps underneath the 
                backpack where you can store things like a hoodie, sleeping pad, 
                picnic mat, etc. There are also straps along the water bottle 
                holder that can act as either extra security for bigger bottles 
                or if you want to strap something else around there.

            <span class="h2">The Cons</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
               While this backpack may be near perfect, there are some cons to 
               this backpack worth mentioning.
               <br>
               <br>
               The backpack lacks a false bottom or some sort of bottom laptop 
               protection for when you store your device inside. I think at bare
               minimum, North Face could have made the laptop compartment more 
               secure at this price point.
               <br>
               <br>
               Another con to the backpack are the insanely long shoulder strap
               adjusters. The length is not necessarily the con itself, but the 
               lack of organization of the straps is where I think can be a con 
               for some. It is kind of weird because there is an elastic band 
               for the sleeping pad straps underneath the backpack (and those 
               straps are much shorter).
               <br>
               <br>
               For travelers (with roller lugages), this backpack does not have 
               a luggage strap attached to the back panel unfortunately. I have 
               had some success when using both the sternum strap and waist strap 
               as a luggage strap, but it definitely did not perform nearly as 
               well.
               <br>
               <br>
               The backpack does not stand on its own. Might not seem like a 
               con, but it definitely is worth mentioning.
            </p>
            <span class="h2">Conclusion</span>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In summary, I think The North Face backpack delivers in many 
                aspects, particularily the quality of materials, and the 
                versatility of the bag. It is a great choice for anyone looking 
                for a great daypack whether it is for day-to-day life, or for 
                their travels. However, I think the lack of drop-protection for 
                laptops are worth noting when considering this backpack. Though, 
                this an easy fix if you get creative enough. That also goes for 
                the lack of a dedicated luggage strap. While these may not be 
                deal-breakers for everyone, depending on how you decide to use 
                the bag, they are worth considering. Overall though, if you 
                value durability, and a great design at a reasonable price, 
                I would highly recommend this backpack.
